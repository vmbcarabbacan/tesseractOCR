Ensure that the GD library is enabled in your PHP installation. You can usually enable it by uncommenting or adding the following line in your php.ini file:
extension=gd
extension=imagick

Before you can use Imagick in PHP, you need to ensure that the Imagick extension is installed and enabled on your server. If Imagick is not already installed, you can typically install it using package managers like apt (for Debian-based systems) or yum (for CentOS/RHEL-based systems). For example, on Ubuntu, you can install Imagick using the following command:

sudo apt-get install php-imagick
